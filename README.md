# CloudCipher Server

This is the main server for CloudCipher. This project is developed as part of my undergraduate thesis.

## Development

1. Ensure you have JDK 17 installed on your system. You can download Liberica Full JDK 17
   from [BellSoft's website](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts).
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
4. Set your environment variables in the `.env` file. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
5. Run the application. With Maven, you can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
